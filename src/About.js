                    with a private practice in Brooklyn, New York, treating adolescents and
                    adults presenting with depression, anxiety, trauma, self-harm behaviors,
                    and substance use concerns using a collaborative, client-centered approach
                    that incorporates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational
                    Interviewing (MI) frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>Previously, Dr. Cabral served as the Counseling Center Director at St.
                    Joseph’s University in Brooklyn, as well as the  Clinical Director at PRIDE
                    (Promoting Resilience, Intersectionality, Diversity, and Equity) Research
                    Consortium affiliated with Hunter College. At PRIDE, Dr. Cabral provided
                    clinical supervisory support for short-term manualized interventions intended
                    to reduce HIV transmission and risky sexual behavior with at-risk populations
                    such as men who have sex with men and transgender emerging adults.
                </p>
                <p>Dr. Cabral received their doctoral degree from St. John’s University,
                    where their research fellowship focused on the assessment and treatment
                    of trauma in racial/ethnic minority communities throughout Western Queens.
                    They have provided clinical treatment to adolescents in day treatment
                    settings with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders,
                    adolescent survivors of physical and sexual abuse, and students in
                    school-based settings with a variety of mental health concerns using
                    evidence based, trauma-informed, and culturally competent treatment
                    interventions. In doing so, Dr. Cabral has developed expertise in
                    trauma-informed care and an understanding of the relationship between
                    identity development, trauma, and health outcomes.
