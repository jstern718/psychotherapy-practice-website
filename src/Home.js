                        <p>As a therapist, I think it’s important to pay attention to the stories that
                            we tell ourselves about our lives.</p>
                        <p>Cynthia Cabral, Ph.D. (pronouns: they/she) is a clinical psychologist
                            with a private practice in Brooklyn, New York, treating adolescents and
                             adults presenting with depression, anxiety, trauma, self-harm behaviors,
                             and substance use concerns using a collaborative, client-centered approach
                             that incorporates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational
                             Interviewing (MI) frameworks.
                        </p>

                        <p>Previously, Dr. Cabral served as the Counseling Center Director at St.
                            Joseph’s University in Brooklyn, as well as the  Clinical Director at PRIDE
                            (Promoting Resilience, Intersectionality, Diversity, and Equity) Research
                            Consortium affiliated with Hunter College. At PRIDE, Dr. Cabral provided
                            clinical supervisory support for short-term manualized interventions intended
                            to reduce HIV transmission and risky sexual behavior with at-risk populations
                            such as men who have sex with men and transgender emerging adults.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Cabral received their doctoral degree from St. John’s University,
                                where their research fellowship focused on the assessment and treatment
                                of trauma in racial/ethnic minority communities throughout Western Queens.
                                They have provided clinical treatment to adolescents in day treatment
                                settings with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders,
                                adolescent survivors of physical and sexual abuse, and students in
                                school-based settings with a variety of mental health concerns using
                                evidence based, trauma-informed, and culturally competent treatment
                                interventions. In doing so, Dr. Cabral has developed expertise in
                                trauma-informed care and an understanding of the relationship between
                                identity development, trauma, and health outcomes.

                    self. In our work together, I would use a client-centered,
                    collaborative approach to identify the parts of your story
                    that may need “editing” and then address those areas using
                    evidence-based, trauma informed, culturally sensitive
                    therapeutic approaches (like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy).</p>

                    depression, anxiety, & harm reduction. In my work with
                    clients, I invite conversations about systemic inequality
                    (i.e., racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia) and I
                    encourage clients to explore their concerns in these larger
